    "Prometheus Steals Fire": """
    Long ago, humans lived in darkness without fire. Zeus had forbidden humans from having fire, 
    keeping it exclusively for the gods. Prometheus, a Titan who had helped create humans from clay, 
    felt sorry for their suffering. Against Zeus's orders, Prometheus stole fire from Mount Olympus by 
    hiding a flame in a hollow fennel stalk and brought it to humanity. This gift allowed humans to cook food, 
    stay warm, and begin developing civilization. When Zeus discovered this betrayal, he was furious. As punishment, 
    Zeus had Prometheus chained to a rock where an eagle would eat his liver each day, only for it to regenerate 
    each night so his torment could continue eternally. Eventually, Heracles (Hercules) freed Prometheus from 
    this punishment during his twelve labors.
    """,
    
    "Persephone and the Seasons": """
    Persephone was the beautiful daughter of Demeter, goddess of the harvest. One day while gathering flowers, 
    she was abducted by Hades, god of the underworld, who had fallen in love with her. Demeter was devastated 
    and in her grief, she caused all plants on Earth to wither and die, creating the first winter. Zeus eventually 
    intervened and ordered Hades to return Persephone. However, because Persephone had eaten six pomegranate seeds 
    in the underworld, she was bound to return to Hades for six months each year. During these months when Persephone 
    is with Hades, Demeter mourns and winter comes to the world. When Persephone returns to her mother, Demeter rejoices 
    and spring begins, explaining the cycle of the seasons.
    """,
    
    "The Judgment of Paris": """
    At the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Eris, the goddess of discord, tossed a golden apple inscribed "For the fairest" 
    among the guests. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Zeus appointed Paris, a prince of Troy, 
    to judge who should receive the apple. Each goddess offered Paris a bribe: Hera offered power, Athena offered wisdom and 
    skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Aphrodite's gift, 
    awarding her the golden apple. With Aphrodite's help, Paris abducted Helen (who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta), 
    which led directly to the Trojan War, one of the most devastating conflicts in Greek mythology.
    """,
    
    "Orpheus and Eurydice": """
    Orpheus was a legendary musician whose music could charm all living things. He fell deeply in love with and married the beautiful 
    nymph Eurydice. Shortly after their wedding, Eurydice was bitten by a venomous snake and died. Devastated, Orpheus traveled to the 
    underworld to bring her back. His music so moved Hades and Persephone that they agreed to let Eurydice return to the world of the living, 
    but with one condition: Orpheus must walk in front of her and not look back until they both reached the upper world. As they neared the 
    surface, Orpheus, anxious to see if Eurydice was still behind him, turned to look at her. Because he turned before they had both reached 
    the upper world, Eurydice immediately vanished, this time forever. Orpheus spent the rest of his life in mourning until he too was killed, 
    finally reuniting with his beloved in the underworld.
    """,
    
    "Arachne's Challenge": """
    Arachne was a talented mortal weaver who boasted that her skills surpassed even those of Athena, goddess of crafts. Hearing this, 
    Athena disguised herself as an old woman and gave Arachne a chance to retract her boast. When Arachne refused, Athena revealed herself 
    and challenged Arachne to a weaving contest. Arachne's tapestry was flawless and depicted the gods' failings and misdeeds. Athena could 
    find no fault with Arachne's work but was angered by the disrespectful subject matter. In a fit of rage, Athena tore Arachne's tapestry 
    and struck her with her shuttle. Humiliated, Arachne attempted to hang herself. Taking pity, Athena transformed Arachne into a spider, 
    allowing her to weave for all eternity. This myth explains the origin of spiders and serves as a warning against pride and challenging the gods.
